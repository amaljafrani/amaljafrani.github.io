                    <h3>Project Description</h3>
                    <p>As we entered this project, we found that we were all 
                    drawn toward the topic of accessing electronic health records. 
                    We had all struggled with electronic healthcare at one point or
                     another, and we anticipated that current systems in this area 
                     would be problematic and lacking for many other people as well.
                    </p>
                    <p>Our main goal in this project was to <b>minimize the complexity and 
                    confusion</b> associated with the health record request process to 
                    create a more streamlined and personalized experience on the
                     patient side. In turn, this would <b>reduce the amount of time 
                     and resources UPMC’s patient services</b> department would have 
                     to devote to customer service.

                <h3>Research</h3>
                <p>Individually, we started off by doing some <b>pop-up research</b>.
                    Each member interviewed at least 3 people and created a 
                    customer journey map for each interviewee. We used 
                <b>directed storytelling</b> to conduct these interviews.
                    At this point, we hadn’t yet narrowed down our target 
                    user because we wanted to see what part of the customer
                    experience journey people struggled with the most first 
                    before deciding how we could effectively tailor our
                    solution to that specific group.

                    <h3>Identifying Issues</h3>
                    <p>We identified the two main issues as:</p>
                    <li>Miscommunication</li>
                    <li>Lack of Standardization</li> 
                    <br>
                    <p>On the medical side there is lack of 
                            standardization between health care systems, 
                            which makes it difficult to manage and locate
                            different records or documents. Additionally,
                            it is frustrating communicating between different
                            health care professionals and organizations when
                            it comes to getting assistance with the record
                            retrieval process. This leads to issues on the
                            user side. There is a lack of clarity throughout 
                            the process, which makes it tedious and frustrating
                            for the user.

                <p>We realized we could not transform the 
                    entire health care industry, but we needed to focus on 
                    a client to address. We chose to focus on <b>UPMC</b>, 
                    since most of our participants were in Pittsburgh. More specifically,
                    the <b>Customer Service Department</b>, as our solution aims to decrease patient confusion
                    and reliance on customer service and doctors.

                    <h3>Exploring Solutions</h3>
                    <p>We were exploring ways to improve communication, 
                       keep the user informed in what step of the process 
                       they’re at, and having a more personalized experience.
                       While brainstorming we were inspired by amazons chatbox. 
                       We wanted to create a more personal experience for users 
                       to reduce confusion for the user, and decrease the amount 
                       of support users would need. Our goal was to create a 
                       platform that had a clear flow, and would guide the user 
                       through each step, as well as help them make decisions 
                       using an AI-based platform.

                    <h3>Bringing Our Research Together</h3>
                    <p>Through our research, we found that most of the problems 
                       for users were at the requesting phase. In the requesting 
                       phase our users were most frustrated because of the long 
                       and tedious process in comparison to other phases, which would also
                       cause issues in other pases.
                    </p>
                    <p> For example, identifying and locating the records in preparation for the requesting phase
                        and assessing records after they have been requested also cause stress for our 
                        participants. Therefore, through <b>focusing on the requesting phase</b> 
                        we were also able to address issues that came up in other phases, 
                        as well as addressing problems that arised in the requesting phase.
                    </p>

            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-lg-5">
                    <p>During the think aloud testing in class our peers were able
                         to follow the process Albert would take and begin the 
                         request process, but our peers did bring up a scenario 
                         in which the user would want to have a form filled out 
                         with information. In the prototype we provided the Request 
                         Purpose screen only had options in which the user 
                         would want to request a record that already exists.
                    </p>
                    <p>In order to solve this we added another possible 
                        selection on the Request Purpose page. We added a 
                        custom form selection, so that the user would be 
                        able to select that if they had a form they needed 
                        filled out by the doctor.

                        health concerns Albert has, and deciding if it is 
                        something that should be highlighted on the record.

                    <p>Our peers were able to identify the health concerns

                        about what the question at the bottom meant. 
                        Additionally, not every individual would have 
                        specific health concerns, so it should be optional

                        decisions we made were <b>specific to Albert</b>, and that 
                        we needed to think more generally regarding other use 
                        cases too. We also wanted to refine our record selection 
                        page most in the next prototype because during our think 
                        aloud testing this step caused the most confusion.

                    <h3>Record Selection</h3>
                    <p>After designing our paper prototypes exclusively for 
                        desktop, we decided to do our next iteration for <b>mobile</b> 
                        in order to start defining the responsive features and 
                        polish the overall layout.

                    </p>
                    <p>Additionally, the Highlight Eelements question is optional. To save screen 
                        real estate on the mobile device we have made it a drop down that takes
                        up minimal space if the user decides not to answer the question.

                    <h3>Visual Design and Color</h3>
                    <p>At this stage in our design process, we introduced <b>color 
                        and icons into the design.</b>
                    </p>
                    <p>For example, we used an icon of a document with checkmarks with the 
                         label “Record Requests” under it so that users would be 
                         drawn to it faster than browsing the menu.
                    </p>
                    <p>We introduced a color palette of dark purple, light 
                        purple, white, and gray in order to portray the clean 
                        and minimalist feel of a hospital’s platform, while 
                        using color psychology with purple to represent the 
                        brand’s wisdom and reliability.

                    <p>Through the feedback we received on our 
                        med-fi prototype, we found that there were 
                        several main issues in regards to <b>visual hierarchy, 
                        structure, and how specific elements fit into the 
                        overall context and purpose of our design.</b>
                    </p>
                    <li>The out-of-place “Highlight Elements” 
                        disrupted the overall visual hierarchy and 
                        flow of the page.</li>
                    <li>Redundancy of the Personal Info page</li>
                    <li>Not enough visual feedback when an item is selected</li>
                    <li> Search function is too ambiguous</li>

                    <h3>Overview of Changes</h3>
                    <p>For our high fidelity prototype, we focused on 
                        both addressing the issues in our previous iteration 
                        and adding additional key features that were missing.
                    </p>
                    <li>Moved the “Highlight Elements” function to the “Request

                    </li>
                    <li> Removed the redundant “Personal Info” page to streamline the process</li>
                    <li>Merged and restructured the “Request Records” and 
                        “Health History” pages to become the “Health Records” 
                        page

                    <li>Cleared up ambiguity regarding the search function and where

                    <p>Our main goals in implementing micro interactions

                    <h3>Reflection</h3>
                    <p>This project taught our group how to keep moving forward 
                        in the design process. Especially during the early 
                        stages of research, we were caught up in the little 
                        details and wanting to make sure we had all the information 
                        before proceeding to the next step in the design process. 
                        Even after our pop-up research, we wanted to do a second 
                        round of research to explore different avenues we had not 
                        yet looked into. It was hard for us to get past this and 
                        just pick a direction to go in. Understanding this idea 
                        of ‘keep moving forward’ was really important because it 
                        helped us not get stuck. There’s never really going to be 
                        one decision to leads to the perfect solution. Using our 
                        research, we just had to keep making decisions and eventually 
                        we came to an effective solution.
