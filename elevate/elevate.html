                    <p>Elevate makes users <b>more conscious of their belongings</b>, 
                        while also creating an aesthetic piece of furniture

                        During this time we are all stuck in our houses 
                        with limited activity and day to day interaction. 
                        Elevate provides a response to your 
                        actions to emphasize and highlight the importance 
                        of your belongings.

                    <h3>Choosing a Direction</h3>
                    <p>As a team we were drawn to the idea of smart living. We
                        began brainstorming items that could replace regular 
                        furniture and make it interactive. 
                    </p> 
                    <p>We decided to move forward with creating a <b>responsive coffee
                        table</b> as it would reach a wide set of users.

                        In our sketches we began exploring different forms 
                        the table could take. We didn't want the entire table to
                        respond, so we thought of <b>splitting the table into multiple 
                        pannels.</b> Each pannel would respond
                        based on the interaction.

                    <p>
                        We started to think about different components we will 
                        need to move forward. We would need the following:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>linear actuator to move the panels</li>
                        <li>LED lights for a backlight</li> 
                        <li>load sensor to sense interaction</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The next step in our process 
                        was to  create a prototype 
                        of one of the panels with all the components.

                    <p>
                        After brainstorming a couple ideas on how to 
                        approach the project we created a <b>3-D digital model</b>
                        to mimic what we imagined the final product would look like and function
                        like.

                    <h3>Planning</h3>
                    <p>The table would be made from a quarter 
                        inch plywood and would have a panel located towards the 
                        top which the circuit can sit on. </p>
                    <p>
                        As for the circuit we planed to have a stepper motor 
                        attached to a 3-D printed part that was shaped 
                        like an egg. As the stepper motor rotates 
                        the egg would push the panels upwards. 
                        The FSR would be placed between the two top panels, 
                        so based on whether there is any force the motor would 
                        spin. We would also have legs to prevent the panels from tilting. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        For our initial prototype we had not printed any 
                        parts yet, so we experimented with popsicle sticks
                         and other items provided in our course kit. We 
                         attached part of a popsicle stick to our servo 
                         motor to push the panel up. We had wooden dowels 
                         that we used as temporary legs and plastic rings 
                         to hold them in place.
                    </p>
                    <p>We focused on creating a 
                        prototype for one panel first, since it would be 
                        the same thing repeated multiple times. After building out 
                        our first prototype we noticed two main problems.

                        results were quite varied and at times the FSR did not

                        back light highlighting the mug. Elevate was successful 
                        in interacting with us, and treating the item with more consciousness rather
                        than ignoring it.

                    <p>
                        Through this process I have learned that 
                        <b>3-D modeling is extremely idealistic</b>, especially with 
                        moving components. In rhino it is very easy to have 
                        complete control over each component, but in reality 
                        they bring their own hurdles that are not highlighted 
                        in a digital model.
