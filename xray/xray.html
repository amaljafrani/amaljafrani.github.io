                    <p>Our first group assignment of IxDS1 was to create a 
                        display tailored for two users and a stakeholder 
                        to help the adidas team. We had to analyze our 
                        personas to understand the key needs of the users/stakeholder.
                        This is a display that <b>distills the stream of data into 
                        actionable data insights to spark ideas, collaboration 
                        and ultimately drive the team to innovate</b> Adidas fashion

                    <p>We identified a <b>key driver</b> for each user from our diagram 
                        to use in a current and future state diagram. The next 
                        step of our project definition was creating a current/future

                    <p>We chose a defining problem for each user and imagined

                    <h3>Sketches</h3>
                    <p>As we transitioned from problem definition to solution 
                        ideation, each team member individually sketched possible 
                        solutions. This resulted in a wide range of ideas that 
                        would ultimately inspire future iterations. With a variety 
                        of ideas, our next step was to <b>identify the key ideas and 
                        refine the focus</b> of our first iteration.
                    </p>
                    <p>Upon reflection, we agreed it would have been beneficial 
                        to spend more time on ideation, but due to time constraints, 
                        we were forced to focus on a limited 2-3 sketches. That 
                        being said, the ideas we did focus on, combined with the 
                        direction from the critique, provided us with a solid 
                        foundation of purpose to move forward with to iteration 1.

                <h3>Low-fidelity</h3>
                <p>Armed with a refinement of our key ideas and feedback 
                        from our sketch critique, we moved toward creating 
                        the first iteration of what would become our dashboard.
                         Before we set out in the design process we decided on 
                         a constraint to guide our thinking: the primary goal 
                         of our dashboard.
                </p>
                <p><b>Primary Goal:</b> Leverage social media data and business 
                        analytics to empower data-driven innovation and inspire Kenny and Sos <br>
                </p>
                <p>With this goal, we also gave ourselves the constraint that <b>Kenny and 
                        Sos would be the primary users</b> of this dashboard and <b>Ansela would be 
                        the managing Client</b> on the project. With this purpose as our guide, 
                </p>
                <p>We set off to design our first iteration based on the following:</p>

                    <p>It was a boost to the team’s morale to see the dashboard taking
                        shape and seeing how we could improve it. During the crit, 
                        it was both refreshing and scary to see that we had taken a 
                        different approach from most groups. Based on the feedback 
                        we receive we needed to improve <b>what the overall score is

                <p>We had to further think

                    <p>We had gone into the design process with a basic 5-button 
                        control intended to allow the user to switch through

                        other controls that had <b>horizontal and vertical movement</b> 
                        for the views and subviews.

                        The main issue we found with the <b>joy stick and 
                        trackball</b> was the lack of precision that would 
                        come from a 360 degree allowance. So, we landed back 
                        at our original 5-button control design.
